# Home Assistant Server Health Dashboard
A demo of how to integrate home assistant system monitor.
We build out the dashboard below to track cpu, memory, disk usage, temperature, speedtests, and status of the services running on our home server.

Simply copy the code in the `server-health.yaml` file and paste it into your new dashboard via the raw configuration code editor.
